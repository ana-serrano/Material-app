	* For details about the implementation of the editing process, please refer to the main paper:
		An intuitive control space for material appearance
		Ana Serrano, Diego Gutierrez, Karol Myszkowski, Hans-Peter Seidel, and Belen Masia
		ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. of SIGGRAPH Asia 2016)
		<a href="http://webdiis.unizar.es/~aserrano/projects/Material-Appearance.html" target="_blank">Project Page</a>
	
	* Author of the GUI interface: Miguel Barrio
		
	* Note: The gradient descent described in the paper has been replaced for a more efficient nonlinear optimization method.
	
	<b>Requirements :</b>
	
		- Windows OS 
		- Python 2.7  (including numpy library)
		- <a href="https://www.disneyanimation.com/technology/brdf.html" target="_blank">BRDF explorer</a>
		
	<b>How to use :</b>
	
		- Load a BRDF file.
		
		- Use the sliders or the textboxes to reach different values for each of the attributes available to edit. 
		  Note that changing one attribute value may affect the other attributes as described in the main paper. 
		  It is recommended to stay within the range [0.1 - 0.9] since extreme values may behave unexpectedly 
		  in some cases.
		  
		- Alternatively, a new BRDF can be defined by clicking the <i>pick</i> button and selecting a point
		  inside the plot showing a slice of the space. 
		  		
		- Once the desired value is achieved, press the <i>Render</i> button to load the current BRDF 
		  using <i>BRDF Explorer</i>. Enable the <i>Autorender</i> checkbox to automatically render each step.
		
		- The <i>Log</i> box displays information about the state of the program.	
			
	<b>About the toolbar commands :</b>
	
		- <i>Load BRDF</i> : Loads a BRDF (.binary) file. 
		- <i>Save BRDF</i> : Saves a BRDF (.binary) file. 
		 
	<b>About the render command :</b>
		
		- The render command comunicates with <i>BRDF explorer</i> in order to render the edited BRDFs. This feature relies 
		  on a Visual Basic script that sends keys, so it is important to wait for the script to end before continuing 
		  with the edits.		
				 
	<b>About the plots :</b>
	
		- The main plot shows a slice of the trained RBF for the selected attribute, as well as the limits of the convex hull. 
		  The convex hull defines the boundaries that constrain the minimization (see main paper for more information). 
		- The pair of alphas (PC components) that are displayed in the plot can be chosen with the corresponding X-Y dropdown menus.
		  The alpha values that are not being displayed are fixed to the values of the current BRDF.
		- The bars below the main plot display a 1D slice of the RBF along each of the five alphas (PC components).
