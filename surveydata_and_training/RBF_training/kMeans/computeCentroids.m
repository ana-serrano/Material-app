function centroids = computeCentroids(X, prev_centroids, memberships, k)
%COMPUTECENTROIDS Computes the centroids for the k clusters by taking the 
%average value of the data points in the cluster.
%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, memberships, k) returns the new centroids 
%   by computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. 
%
%   Parameters
%     X           - The dataset, with one sample per row.
%     memberships - The index of the centroid that the corresponding data point
%                   in X belongs to (a value in the range 1 - k).
%     k           - The number of clusters.
%
%   Returns
%     A matrix of centroids, with k rows where each row contains a centroid.
