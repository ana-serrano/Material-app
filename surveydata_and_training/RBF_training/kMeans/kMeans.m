function [centroids, memberships] = kMeans(X, initial_centroids, max_iters)
%KMEANS Run the k-means clustering algorithm on the data set X.
%   [centroids, memberships] = KMEANS(X, initial_centroids, max_iters)
%   Runs the k-means algorithm on the dataset X where 'k' is given by the
%   number of initial centroids in 'initial_centroids'
%
%   This function will test for convergence and stop when the centroids don't
%   change from one iteration to the next. It will also break after 'max_iters'
%   iterations.  
%
%   The initial centroids should all be unique. They are typically taken 
%   randomly from the data set. See the 'kMeansInitiCentroids' function for
%   selecting random, unique points from X as your initial centroids. Note that
%   the choice of initial centroids will affect the final clusters. To get
%   repeatable results from k-means, you need to use the same initial 
%   centroids.
%
%   Parameters
%     X                 - The dataset, with one example per row.
%     initial_centroids - The initial centroids to use, one per row (there
%                         should be 'k' rows).
%     max_iters         - The maximum number of iterations to run (k-means will
%                         stop sooner if it converges).
%   Returns
%     centroids    -  A k x n matrix of centroids, where n is the number of 
%                    dimensions in the data points in X.
%     memberships  - A column vector containing the index of the assigned 
%                    cluster (a value between 1 - k) for each corresponding 
%                    data point in X.
